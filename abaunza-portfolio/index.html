        <h2>Computer Science Background</h2>
        <p>
        I am a senior Computer Science student at George Mason University. 
        It is there that I learned Java and C as well as various other topics such as data structures, 
        database concepts, and algorithms. It really helped me establish the fundamentals of programming in general.
        I currently reside in Centreville, Virginia 
        and am looking to work remotely or anywhere in the Northern Virginia and DC Metropolitan Area 
        as a front-end developer, back-end developer, or software engineer!
        </p>
        <h2>Independent Learner</h2>
        <p>
        While I have studied a copious amount of things at George Mason University, a good portion of my skills have been from learning independently.
        This includes most of the skills needed for web design. In my personal time, I taught myself through online resources and 
        by working on personal projects, which are the ones you can view on this portfolio. 
        I started by learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Once I got comfortable with those languages, 
        I moved on to back-end development with Node.js/Express and then to frameworks for front-end and unit testing.
        I'm always learning new things, both in and out of school as I'm eager to learn as much as I can.
